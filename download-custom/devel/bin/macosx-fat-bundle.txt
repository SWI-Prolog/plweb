Mac OS X disk image with [relocatable application
bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_%28macOS%29#macOS_application_bundles).
The bundle also provides the commandline tools in the ``Contents/MacOS``
directory. Users of older MacOS versions are adviced to use Macports,
Homebrew or install from source.  This bundle contains universal (fat)
binaries that run natively on Intel and Apple Silicon (M*, arm64).
