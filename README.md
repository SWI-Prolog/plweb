# The SWI-Prolog web-site

This repository contains the software  of http://www.swi-prolog.org. The
(wiki) content of the website and  required   add-ons  are stored in git
submodules. These must be installed separately  using the command below.
To  install  the  site  from  scratch  locally,  perform  the  following
commands:

  1. Downloading the site

       ```
       % git clone https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/plweb.git
       % cd plweb
       % git submodule update --init
       ```

  2. For a full installation, install the dynamic data.  The .db
    files must be writeable by the server process.

     <dl>
       <dt>annotations.db</dt>
       <dd>Comments on web pages</dd>
       <dt>tags.db</dt>
       <dd>Tags on web pages</dd>
       <dt>openid.db</dt>
       <dd>User administration</dd>
       <dt>packs.db</dt>
       <dd>Known packages</dd>
       <dt>post.db</dt>
       <dd>News posts</dd>
       <dt>reviews.db</dt>
       <dd>Pack reviews</dd>
       <dt>download</dt>
       <dd>Points to the download directory</dd>
     </dl>

     Install the download descriptions by running the script `install-custom`

  3. Create directories for logging and pack mirrors.  These
     directories must be writeable by the server and new directories
     created below must have the same permissions:

      ```
      % mkdir log pack
      % chgrp www-data log pack
      % chmod g+ws log pack
      ``` 

## Running the site

After installation, the  website  may  be   started  locally  using  the
commands below. After that, you  have  access   to  the  same content as
available  from  http://www.swi-prolog.org,  except   for  the  download
section of the website. The  default  port   of  the  site  is 3040, and
therefore it may be accessed on http://localhost:3040/

```
% swipl -s load.pl
?- server.
```

### Running as daemon using Ubuntu upstart

A good way to run the website on a   Linux server is by creating a Linux
container using lxc. After installing the server,   you can enable it to
start at boot time by   copying `upstart/swi-prolog.conf` to `/etc/init`
after editing it to suit your   configuration  requirements. By default,
the server runs as user `www-data`, group `www-data` as specified in the
above configuration file.

Make sure the following components are  writeable to the server process.
For files, this means mode 664,   group  www-data. For directories, this
means mode 2775, group www-data.

* log

  Write httpd.log and pack-warnings.log

* pack

  Mirrors known packages.  Will be populated as the server is started.

* www: subdirectories and .txt files

  Needs to make the wiki pages editable.  It is also wise to do this in
  a git branch.  From the www directory, do:

     ```
     % git checkout master
     % git pull
     % git checkout -b wiki
     % find . -type d | xargs chmod 2775
     % find . -name '*.txt' | xargs chmod 664
     % chgrp -W www-data .
     ```

* *.db


## Issues with the locally running site

  - There is no download section (but that can't be a big issue)

  - If you want to use the _login_ facility to play with the
    interactive aspects of the site, you need to

      1. Get a reCAPTCHA key-pair from Google

      2. Run (from a started server)

          ```
          ?- set_setting(recaptcha:public_key, 'public key goes here').
          ?- set_setting(recaptcha:private_key, 'private key goes here').
          ?- save_settings.
          ```

      3. Run the server from a port that is accessible from the public
         internet.

      4. Use an OpenID provider that is not too picky for your site.
         In our experience, Google is less picky than Yahoo.
